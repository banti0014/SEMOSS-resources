Our team utilizes text widgets, default handles, custom click events, etc. in different ways. We have put together a repository of examples for you to leverage when needed.

For further explanation, please reference the _SEMOSS_ [user guide].

What files are included?
------

> Text Widget

Each text widget folder contains a different type of template and will have the following files available for download:

* HTML file which is the code to include in the text widget
* An image of the output
* Any queries if applicable
* The compiled pixel query

> Default Handle

Each default handle is a different template and will include the JSON file format used to generate the default handle

Can I contribute my own files?
-----
Yes! We highly encourage the _SEMOSS_ community to contribute to the resources that can then be shared with others. To ensure your inputs can be used by the community, please follow these guidelines.

* Include all necessary files (image, pixel, etc.) that are used in the section you are contributing to.
* As much as possible, comment your code so users can follow.
* Have your contributions work for MovieDatabase or College or any other public database that can be scaled to other users.
